# Campground-Reservations-Sim

HOW TO USE: 
1.) Import the package into eclipse.
2.) Use termindal to cd into the database folder and run campground.sql.
3.) Then simply run CampgroundCLI as a java application in eclipse.

Purpose of App:
  This was a project that myself and a fellow student created during the Tech Elevator Java bootcamp. The purpose of this project was to use a database connection alongside java to simulate an application that people would use to check avaliability of certain campsites at variouse national parks.
  
Personal Notes:
  Looking back at this project is sort of embarassing because of how messy the code is. If I were to go back and do this project again, I would have refactored alot of the functionallity in the CLI to make it more readable to other users.
